Combined Heat and Power (CHP): CHP systems generate electricity and heat from a single fuel source.Waste heat from CHP systems can be stored and used to meet heating and cooling demands during periods of high energy demand.District heating and cooling: Waste heat can be captured and used to heat and cool buildings and cooling systems.TES systems can help capture and store waste heat for later use during peak demand periods.Solar Thermal:Solar thermal systems use the heat received from the sun to generate eleectricity or heat.MAJOR CHALLENGES IN PCM-BASED TES SYSTEMS The following significant challenges in the PCM-based TES systems must be addressed to enhance the thermal performance under
