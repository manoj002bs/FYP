CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Overview Atits core, the project hamesses the synergy between cutting-edge technology and the pressing need for inclusivity. Leveraging the ies of the Raspberry Pi and the sophistication of OCR, computational capat technology, the aim of the project is to create a portable and affordable system. This system is designed not merely to capture images of textbooks but to convert those images into spoken words, breaking down the barriers that impede the visually impaired from engaging with written content. ‘The choice of Raspberry Pi as the main processor serves as a testament to the commitment to portability and accessibility. With the powerful combination of Tesseract OCR and OpenCV, the project not only captures pages of textbooks but optimizes them for superior legibility and recognition. 1.2 Motivation ‘The motivation behind this project is anchored in ensuring accessibility for every visually impaired individual. Recognizing the financial constraints faced by many in this community, the project strategically utilizes cost-effective components such as the Raspberry Pi and ‘open-source software. By providing an affordable alternative, we aim to democratize access to OCR and TTS technologies, offering a transformative tool that not only enriches the lives of visually impaired individuals but also serves as a cost-effective model for broader societal impact,
