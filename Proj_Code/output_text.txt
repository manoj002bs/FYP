52 RAMAYANA thus and in many other ways he dwells on the qualities that made Raama the ideal man. Raama’s graceful frame and virile beauty, his strength, his courage, the purity of his heart, his perfect life, his compassion, sweetness of speech, his serenity, his deep wisdom and his statesmanship were admired by the people and made them eagerly look forward to his becoming king. And Dasaratha knew and rejoiced in this expectation. Hence, considering his old age, he wished to crown Raama as Yuvaraaja and entrust © him with the de facto rule of the kingdom. Informing his ministers of his desire, he had the Raaja Sabha convened. Rishis and wise men, leaders of the city and kings from neighbouring lands, attended the Raaja Sabha. When all were seated, each in his appropriate place, Dasaratha rose and addressed them. His deep manly voice, like the sound of a trumpet or the roar of rain-bearing clouds, filled the great hall. A royal radiance shone from his face. His words were full of meaning and charmed all ears. “Like my ancestors, I have tended this kingdom as a mother cares for her child. I have worked unremittingly for the people. Now my body is old and infirm. I wish therefore to appoint my eldest son as Yuvaragja and transfer to him the burden of responsibility. Following the holy custom of my forefathers, I hope to spend the rest of my life in austerities in the forest. Raama is fi to th task of kingshi is fully equal to the P. He is expert in administration and eet and he is unequalled in valour. I can ransfer this trust of Sovereignty to him without any anxiety and I hope that this honoured as i Permit me to do so.” eee:
